Observations: As there were no or very high level requirements to validate the application, here are my observations from the exploratory testing ,
 
1) Name fields accepts a long text (I could enter up to 72 characters for name fields, it accepts but can’t display it properly up on saving the record)
2) Price field also accepts a big numeric value (I could enter up to 20 digit number, it accepts but again can’t display it properly up on saving the record)
3) Records can be saved when name fields are empty or blank
4) Records can be saved when price fields is empty or blank
5) It accepts numeric values for name fields
6) It accepts special characters for name fields
7) It accepts zero value for price
8) Records can be saved only having entry for deposit field, keeping all other fields blank
9) It accepts long decimal digits for the price (I could enter up to twenty decimal digits)
10) It accepts dates in the past for check in and check out
11) It accepts if check out date is earlier than check in date
12) I couldn’t understand the significance of having ‘Deposit’ field./dropdown, there should be another column/field to add the deposit amount
