Solution overview:

To create a test automation suite I have created a class NewHotel and various methods to perform required activities. It has methods for Starting a new browser session, inserting first record, deleting the record, inserting multiple records and for quitting the browser session. I have also added a small sleep time (wait) after insertion of first record and deletion that user will not miss it. I am also printing messages on eclipse console after each of the three tasks.


Tools needed:

The solution is based on java. You would require Java, Eclipse, Mozilla Firefox browser to run it.
